# Web_Spidering

## Overview
This project extends a basic web spidering and indexing system to incorporate PageRank-based relevance scoring for web search. It builds on the foundational components provided in the ir.webutils package, which includes tools for crawling web pages, saving them to disk, and indexing them for information retrieval (IR).

The main objective is to develop a more intelligent web spider and indexer that accounts for the link structure of web pages, enabling more effective and relevant search capabilities through the incorporation of PageRank scores.
